Dearest
feel
certain
am
going
mad
again
feel
can't
go
through
another
those
terrible
times
And
shan't
recover
this
time
begin
hear
voices
and
can't
concentrate
So
am
doing
what
seems
best
thing
do
You
have
given
me
greatest
possible
happiness
You
have
been
in
every
way
all
anyone
could
be
don't
think
two
people
could
have
been
happier
till
this
terrible
disease
came
can't
fight
any
longer
know
am
spoiling
your
life
without
me
you
could
work
And
you
will
know
You
see
can't
even
write
this
properly
can't
read
What
want
say
all
happiness
my
life
you
You
have
been
entirely
patient
with
me
and
incredibly
good
want
say
everybody
knows
anybody
could
have
saved
me
would
have
been
you
Everything
has
gone
from
me
but
certainty
your
goodness
can't
go
on
spoiling
your
life
any
longer
don't
think
two
people
could
have
been
happier
than
have
been
